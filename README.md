# Insurance-claims-EDA-Hypothesis-Test-Regression-Model
 I have work on a model that could give us an approximation as to what will be the charges of the patients. Nevertheless, we must go deeply into what factors influenced the charge of a specific patient. In order to do this we must look for patterns in our data analysis and gain extensive insight of what the data is telling us.

 # What i did here
 - Exploratory Data Analysis
   - Univariate Analysis
   - Bi-variate and Multi-variate Analysis
 - Statistical Analysis
   - proof/ disproof based on statistical Analysis
 - Use ML model to predict Charges

# Type of Regresion Model We used to predict the Charges
- Linear Regreesion
- KNN
- SVM
- Gradient Boosting

# Create Some new feature using exisitng feature
